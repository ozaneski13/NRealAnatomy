# NRealAnatomy

NRealAnatomy is a 3D AR simulation made with [Unity 2020.3.8](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2020.3.8). 

This demo prepared for [Teknofest](https://www.teknofest.org/en/) visitors by [BITES Defence & Aerospace](https://www.bites.com.tr).

In this [demo](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ozan-e%C5%9Fki-2b804a13b_selamlar-ge%C3%A7en-sene-teknofestte-bi%CC%87tes-activity-6938114393939283968-ITVk?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web), which I prepared using [Nreal DevKit](https://www.nreal.ai) and Unity, you can have an idea about augmented reality technologies while examining human anatomy.
